    "text": "I’m a research associate specializing in Computational Communication Science, with a career that bridges political science, hands-on political work, and empirical research.\nBefore moving to academia, I held a series of roles in German politics over a period of four years: beginning as a personal aide to a state parliamentarian, then serving as an assistant in a Member of the Bundestag’s constituency office, and ultimately stepping up to lead that office as its head. In these positions, I drafted press releases and briefing notes, managed schedules, organized events, and supervised a small team to keep daily operations running smoothly. Alongside this practical experience, I completed a B.A. in Political Science at the University of Freiburg and an M.A. in Political Science at the University of Mannheim, where I specialized in Advanced Quantitative Methods.\nMy research approach combines quantitative methods with a keen interest in how political communication unfolds in digital spaces. I currently focus on the applications of LLMs for text and video classification of political content. As a member of the “Multilevel Flows of Political Communication on Facebook” project, I also studied user behavior on political Facebook pages.\nIn my free time, I enjoy following daily political developments through podcasts, newspapers, and other news outlets, lifting weights, and—most of all—spending time with my family. I’ll occasionally add a bottle of Single Malt Scotch to my collection."
